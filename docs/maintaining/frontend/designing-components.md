# Designing Components

Designing components is very easy for the front-end.

For CSS, we use CSS-In-JS.

We use a library, [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/), which allows us to use a global stylesheet for our components and maintain consistent spacing and padding.

All base components can be found in the `modules` folder, which can be used to build interfaces \(buttons, layout blocks, etc...\)

To do any custom CSS or modifications, you should get familiar with the theme-ui library.
